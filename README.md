# Day 002 – Defining Direction 🎯

## What I did today
- Reflected on what kind of engineer I want to become
- Defined focus areas instead of trying to do everything at once

## Current focus areas
- Core programming (Python / JavaScript)
- Problem solving & logic
- Building small but complete projects
- Writing and documenting my thinking

## Why this matters
Direction reduces confusion. This log will help me stay intentional and accountable.
